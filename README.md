I'm not the best developer. i've been doing this as a hobby for a long time. i wanted my first project on github to be a discord bot because i want people to have fun with it.
The bot has:
-Moderation
-Levelsystem(simple)
-Warning system(simple)
-ticket system(simple)
-TempVoice
-Fun commands
-Tic Tac Toe

feel free to use my code if it helps you.
if there are any bugs just open an issue and I will try to take care of it.

More updates will follow.
